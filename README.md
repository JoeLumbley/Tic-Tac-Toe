# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this app we remake the classic three in a row game, also known as
Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's. This version is resizable, supports
mouse input and has a computer player. It was written in VB.NET in 2023 and
is compatible with Windows 10 and 11.
I'm making a video to explain the code on my YouTube channel.
